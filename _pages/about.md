## ZhiweiXu(许志伟)

I am currently a lecturer at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, China. I am a member of the **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)**, **China Computer Federation (CCF)**, **Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)**, **Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence (CAAI)**, **IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society (IEEE-SMC)**, **IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS)**, and **ACM Special Interest Group on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation (ACM-SIGEVO)**. Recognized as a high-quality content creator and blogging expert in the field of artificial intelligence on CSDN, I have actively contributed to the academic community.

I was awarded the National Scholarship for Master's students in 2019 and the National Scholarship for Doctoral students in 2021 and 2022 by the Ministry of Education of China. Recently, I have achieved significant advancements and breakthroughs in multi-task multi-objective optimization, constrained multi-objective optimization, and high-dimensional multi-objective optimization.

I have participated in two projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and led a youth project funded by the Provincial Natural Science Foundation. I hold three granted patents. My research findings have been published in top-tier international journals such as **IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation**, **IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics**, **Information Sciences**, **Science China: Information Sciences**, and **Applied Soft Computing**.

I was recognized as an Excellent Graduate Student at the Annual Meeting and Academic Seminar of the Wuhan Computer Software Engineering Society in both 2021 and 2022, and won the First Prize at the 2021 CCF Wuhan Excellent Doctoral Student Academic Showcase Forum. I serve as a reviewer for leading international journals including **IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation**, **IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems**, **Information Sciences**, and **Applied Soft Computing**. Additionally, I am a reviewer for international conferences such as the **IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)**, **IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)**, and the **International Conference on Bio-inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)**. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_Lkioz8AAAAJ&hl'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=引用"></a>

My research interests include:

- Evolutionary Computation
- Multi-objective Optimization (many-objective, constrained, multi-task, large-scale, etc.)
- DNA Computing, Encoding, and Self-Assembly
- RNA Structure Prediction
- Multi-objective Path Planning
